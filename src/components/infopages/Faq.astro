              A risk assessment is a process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating the risks associated with an organisation’s use of technology. It is an important step in developing an effective cyber security strategy because it helps organisations understand their risk exposure and prioritize their efforts to mitigate those risks.

            <p class="text-slate-500 text-sm">
              A vulnerability scan is an automated process that identifies known vulnerabilities in an organisation’s systems and networks. A penetration test, on the other hand, is a simulated attack on an organisation’s systems and networks to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. While both are important tools for improving an organisation’s security posture, they serve different purposes and should be used in conjunction with one another.

              Incident response planning involves developing a plan for how an organisation will respond to a cyber security incident such as a data breach or cyber attack. It is important because it helps organisations minimize the impact of an incident by enabling them to respond quickly and effectively.

              Compliance management involves ensuring that an organisation is complying with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards related to information security. It is important because failure to comply can result in legal penalties, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.

              You can train your employees to be more aware of cyber threats by providing regular training on topics such as phishing awareness, password management, and safe internet browsing practices. You can also conduct simulated phishing attacks to test your employees’ awareness and provide feedback on how they can improve.

              It is recommended that organisations review their cyber security posture at least annually to ensure that their defenses remain effective against evolving threats. However, more frequent reviews may be necessary if there are significant changes to your organisation’s technology environment or if there are new threats or vulnerabilities that emerge.
